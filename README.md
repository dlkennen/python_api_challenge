# python_api_challenge
This is the repo for the week 6 API homework.
There are two jupyter notebooks with output csv files and a screen capture of the heatmap.
It contains a two part project. 
In part one, a random set of cities is identified and the OpenWeatherMap API is used to obtain weather data for these cities.
In part 2, the Google Geocode and Places APIs are used to create heat maps for those cities and to plot nearby hotels for a subset of the cities.
